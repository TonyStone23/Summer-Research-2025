# Summer_Research_2025

This repository contains some of the work that I had done during the first half of summer 2025. Dr. ALaa Sheta and myself would go on to publish the paper "GAs-based Weight Optimization of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks for Air Quality Prediction" in the International Journal of Journal Applications.
